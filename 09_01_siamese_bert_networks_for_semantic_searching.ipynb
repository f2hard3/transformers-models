It is of a black colour, and the whole body is covered\\r\\nwith a shell, full as thick and as strong as that of a small crab. There\\r\\nis one preserved in the museum that measures more than six inches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRASSHOPPER.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrasshoppers are too common to need description, as they abound almost\\r\\nwherever there is green grass. One summer only is their period of life;\\r\\nthey are hatched in the spring, and die in the fall; previous to which,\\r\\nthey deposite their eggs in the earth, which the genial warmth of the\\r\\nnext season brings to life. They are food for many of the feathered\\r\\nrace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCRICKET.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two classes of crickets: viz. the field cricket, and the house\\r\\ncricket; the latter inhabits warm places, the holes of the hearth, &c.\\r\\nfrom whence we hear its notes, which are agreeable: it is said, that\\r\\nthey are purchased by some, and kept in a kind of cage, for the sake of\\r\\ntheir music. Field crickets inhabit the meadows, and subsist on roots,\\r\\n&c. as does another species, called the mole cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCUST.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different kinds of the locust; those we are acquainted with,\\r\\nin this country, are represented in the above cut. In some seasons, they\\r\\nare scarcely heard at all; in others, they are more numerous. About the\\r\\nmiddle or latter part of summer, we hear them among the leaves of the\\r\\ntrees: their notes, which are continued about the space of one minute,\\r\\nare loud at the beginning, and grow lower and lower, till they cease;\\r\\nwhen they immediately fly to another tree, begin again, and end in the\\r\\nsame way, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eastern countries, a kind or kinds of locust, at different\\r\\nperiods, have been very numerous, and have done abundance of damage. In\\r\\nthe year 1650, a cloud of locusts entered Russia, in three different\\r\\nplaces; and from thence spread over Poland and Lithuania; the air was\\r\\ndarkened, and the earth covered, in some places, to the depth of four\\r\\nfeet; the trees bent with heir weight, and the damage sustained exceeded\\r\\ncomputation. Locusts were among the plagues of Egypt: sec Exodus, x. 15.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFLEA.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis very troublesome little animal multiplies very fast among old rags,\\r\\ndirt, straw, and litter, where hogs, cats, or dogs sleep; and in the\\r\\nhair and bristles of those creatures: therefore, as a means of avoiding\\r\\nsuch unwelcome neighbours, in the springs the cleanly farmer scrapes up\\r\\nthe rubbish about his woodpile, and around his house and barn, and\\r\\nremoves it into his field, where it also repays him by manuring his\\r\\nlands. They abound in warm countries, particularly in the southern parts\\r\\nof France and Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen examined by a microscope, the flea is a pleasant object. The body\\r\\nis curiously adorned with a suit of polished armour, neatly jointed, and\\r\\nbeset with a great number of sharp pins almost like the quills of a\\r\\nporcupine: it has a small head, large eyes, two horns, or feelers, which\\r\\nproceed from the head, and four long legs from the breast; they are very\\r\\nhairy and long, and have several joints, which fold as it were one\\r\\nwithin another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOUSE.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese loathsome animals, however unwelcome, attend in troops, and add to\\r\\nthe afflictions of the unfortunate and lazy; but they are routed by the\\r\\nhand of industry and cleanliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn examining the louse with a microscope, its external deformity strikes\\r\\nus with disgust. It has six feet, two eyes, and a sort of sting,\\r\\nproboscis, or sucker, with which it pierces the skin, and sucks the\\r\\nblood. The skin of the louse is hard and transparent, with here and\\r\\nthere several bristly hairs: at the end of each leg are two claws, by\\r\\nwhich it is enabled to lay hold of the hairs, on which it climbs. There\\r\\nis scarcely any animal known to multiply so fast as this unwelcome\\r\\nintruder: from an experiment of Lieuenhoek, a louse in eight weeks, may\\r\\nsee five thousand of its descendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the ancients, what is called the lousy disease was not uncommon:\\r\\nAntiochus, Herod, and others are said to have died of this disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nITCH ... MITE.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nCHEGO ... DEATHWATCH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many species of mites, beside the itch animal and mite above:\\r\\nto the naked eye, they appear like moving particles of dust: but the\\r\\nmicroscope discovers them to be perfect animals, having as regular a\\r\\nfigure, and performing all the functions of life as perfectly as\\r\\ncreatures that exceed them many times in bulk: their eggs are so small\\r\\nthat a regular computation shews that 90 millions of them are not so\\r\\nlarge as a common Pigeon\\'s egg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chego is a very small animal, about one fourth the size of a common\\r\\nflea: it is very troublesome, in warm climates, to the poor blacks, such\\r\\nas go barefoot, and the slovenly: it penetrates the skin, under which it\\r\\nlays a bunch of eggs, which swell to the bigness of a small pea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deathwatch, of which there are two kinds, is an insect famous for a\\r\\nticking noise, like a watch, which superstitious people take for a\\r\\npresage of death, in the family where it is heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCORPION.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is one of the largest of the insect tribe. It is met with in\\r\\ndifferent countries, and of various sizes, from two or three inches to\\r\\nnearly a foot in length: it somewhat resembles a lobster, and casts its\\r\\nskin, as the lobster does its shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nScorpions are common in hot countries: they are very bold and watchful:\\r\\nwhen any thing approaches, they erect their tails, and stand ready to\\r\\ninflict the direful sting. In some parts of Italy and France, they are\\r\\namong the greatest pests that plague mankind: they are very numerous,\\r\\nand are most common in old houses, in dry or decayed walls, and among\\r\\nfurniture, insomuch that it is attended with, much danger to remove the\\r\\nsame: their sting is generally a very deadly poison, though not in all\\r\\ncases, owing to a difference of malignity of different animals, or some\\r\\nother cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the time of the children of Israel, scorpions were a plague in Egypt\\r\\nand Canaan, as appears by the sacred writings. See Deuteronomy, viii.\\r\\n15, and other passages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nANTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\'Who can observe the faithful ant,\\r\\n  And not provide for future want.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThese little animals have been for ages considered as patterns of\\r\\nindustry: they were specially noticed by the wise king Solomon. He says,\\r\\n\"go to the ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways, and be wise.\" The ant\\r\\nlays eggs in the manner of common flies; from these eggs are hatched\\r\\nsmall maggots, or worms without legs; these, after a short time, change\\r\\ninto large white aureliae, or chrysales, which are usually called ant\\'s\\r\\neggs. When a nest of these creatures is disturbed, however great their\\r\\nown danger, the care they take of their offspring is remarkable: each\\r\\ntakes in its foreceps, a young one, often larger than itself and carries\\r\\nit off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese little insects form to themselves, with much industry and\\r\\napplication, of earth, sticks, leaves, &c. little hillocks, called\\r\\nant-hills, in the form of a cone: in these, they dwell, breed, and\\r\\ndeposite their stores: they are commonly built in woody places: the\\r\\nbrushy plains on Long-Island abound with them: they are from one to two\\r\\nfeet in height.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHONEY-BEE.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an extraordinary, curious, and remarkably industrious little\\r\\ninsect, to which mankind are indebted for one of the most palatable and\\r\\nwholesome sweets which nature affords; and which was one of the choice\\r\\narticles with which the promised land was said to abound.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every hive of bees, there are three kinds; the queen, the drones,\\r\\nand the labourers: of these last, there are by far the greatest number:\\r\\nand as cold weather approaches, they drive from the hives and destroy\\r\\nthe drones, that have not laboured in summer, and will not let them eat\\r\\nin winter. If bees are examined through a glass hive, all appears at\\r\\nfirst like confusion: but, on a more careful inspection, every animal is\\r\\nfound regularly employed. It is very delightful, when the maple and\\r\\nother trees are in bloom, or the clover in the meadows, to be abroad and\\r\\nhear their busy hum.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Brisk as the busy bee among learning\\'s flowers.\\r\\n  Employ thy youthful sunshine hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDRAGON FLY.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these flies, which are called by many Spindles, there are various\\r\\nspecies. They all have two very large eyes, covering the whole surface\\r\\nof the head. They fly very swiftly, and prey upon the wing, clearing the\\r\\nair of innumerable little flies. The great ones live about water, but\\r\\nthe smaller are common among hedges, and about gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBUTTERFLY.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf butterflies there are many kinds. How wonderful the various changes\\r\\nof this class of insects! The butterflies lay their eggs: from these\\r\\nhatch out worms or caterpillars, which change their skins several times,\\r\\nand, finally, become aureliae, chrysales, or silkworms, out of which\\r\\ncome the beautiful butterflies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSPIDER.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many kinds of spiders; some of which are said to grow to such\\r\\na size that they will catch small birds: some are poisonous, but the\\r\\ngreater part are harmless, although to most people their looks are\\r\\ndisgusting. The web of a spider, which is a net for catching its prey,\\r\\nis an astonishing piece of curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSILK WORM\\r\\n\\r\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note: The heading \\'SILK WORM\\' was added in order to\\r\\nimprove clarity.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silk worm is a very valuable insect: it is produced from an egg of a\\r\\nyellowish colour, about the size of a small pin\\'s head, that is laid by\\r\\na moth, or butterfly. The above cut represents a male and female, and\\r\\nher eggs, of which she lays several hundreds: the moths live but a few\\r\\ndays; they never eat, and die directly after the eggs are laid.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cut shews the appearance of the worm, which at first is very small\\r\\nand black. Its food is the leaves of the white mulberry: as it grows in\\r\\nsize, at four different periods, it apparently sickens, and changes its\\r\\nskin, and finally, when full grown, it spins a ball of silk, called a\\r\\ncone, or cocoon, the thread of which is about three hundred yards long:\\r\\nin the centre of this ball the worm entombs itself, and experiences a\\r\\nchange to a state called an aurelia, or chrysallis, as seen below the\\r\\nball: from this aurelia, the moth that lays the eggs is hatched, and\\r\\nthus goes on the round of this animal\\'s changes, or transmigrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are natives of China, and were brought into Italy, above twelve\\r\\nhundred years ago; from thence into Spain; afterwards into France; much\\r\\nlater into Germany and the northern countries; and some have been reared\\r\\nin the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSAMUEL WOOD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHereby informs the good little Boys and Girls, both of city and country,\\r\\nwho love to read better than to play, that if they will please to call\\r\\nat his JUVENILE BOOK-STORE, NO. 357, Pearl-street, New-York, it will be\\r\\nhis pleasure to furnish them with a great variety of pretty little\\r\\nbooks, with neat nuts, calculated to afford to the young mind pleasing\\r\\nand useful information. Besides many from Philadelphia, New Haven, and\\r\\nelsewhere, he has nearly fifty kinds of his own printing, and proposes\\r\\nto enlarge the number.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HISTORY OF INSECTS***\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n******* This file should be named 10834.txt or 10834.zip *******\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/8/3/10834\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\\'s\\r\\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\\r\\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\\r\\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\\r\\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\\r\\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\\r\\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\\r\\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\\r\\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\\r\\ndownload by the etext year.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\\r\\n\\r\\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\\r\\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\\r\\n\\r\\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\\r\\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\\r\\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\\r\\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\\r\\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\\r\\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\\r\\n\\r\\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\\r\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\\r\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\\r\\n'"

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.',\n",

Other models used the original Weston scale up until ca. 1955. The company continued to publish Weston film ratings after 1955, but while their recommended values often differed slightly from the ASA film speeds found on film boxes, these newer Weston values were based on the ASA system and had to be converted for use with older Weston meters by subtracting 1/3 exposure stop as per Weston\\'s recommendation. Vice versa, \"old\" Weston film speed ratings could be converted into \"new\" Westons and the ASA scale by adding the same amount, that is, a film rating of 100 Weston (up to 1955) corresponded with 125 ASA (as per ASA PH2.5-1954 and before). This conversion was not necessary on Weston meters manufactured and Weston film ratings published since 1956 due to their inherent use of the ASA system; however the changes of the ASA PH2.5-1960 revision may be taken into account when comparing with newer ASA or ISO values.',\n",

In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \"superior.\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.'),\n",
