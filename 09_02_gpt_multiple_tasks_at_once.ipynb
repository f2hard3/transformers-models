For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I\\'ve experienced (without the bitterness of many \"bold\" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!\\nSummarize:  Nice Bold Earthy Flavor!',\n",

They literally fell apart in my hands when I picked them up out of the container.  The fudge filling is so soft and liquidy that it has the consistency of chocolate syrup rather than fudge sauce.  Using something so fluid as the center of the cookie seems like a way to guarantee they won't hold their shape.  Add to that the fact that the solid cookie part is extremely crumbly and the chocolate chips have a tendency to fall off, and you've got a recipe for disaster.  These cookies are without a doubt the messiest I've ever eaten.  I lost more to the floor and my shirt than I managed to get into my mouth.

       " 'Summarize Task\\nReview: Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you\\'d better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />\"Where is it?\"<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don\\'t step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It\\'s not as \"convenient\" as they\\'d have you believe. You don\\'t just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it\\'s going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don\\'t make a habit of doing this, I\\'m certain that eventually you\\'ll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it\\'s hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...\"no delay in presenting?\" Hmm. There\\'s typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what\\'s coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it\\'s so messy that you\\'d have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can\\'t call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don\\'t get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we\\'ve still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn\\'t be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven\\'t used them yet as a \"distraction\" or \"soothing\" technique; I suppose this might work, although you\\'d clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn\\'t necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it\\'s an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I\\'m sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You\\'re far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a \"Lickety Stick.\"<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It\\'s a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they\\'re both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess.

       " \"Summarize Task\\nReview: One of my Amazon reviewer friends called my attention to birch beer after I had posted a review of Mexican Coca Cola (surprisingly good, by the way). I had heard of birch beer in the distant past, but hadn't seen it or reference to it for at least 3-4 decades. I guess it was one of those old fashioned things that had largely faded away. Out of curiosity, I stopped in at the local Bevmo store and there was a variety of birch beers. Ibought a couple bottles of Sioux City Birch Bear, just to give it a try. Well, it's old fashioned, all right, coming in bottles, but modern in having the newer twist-off caps. I looked at the ingredients and was dismayed to find High Fructose Corn Syrup listed. I expected all cane sugar. I also noticed artificial flavoring and coloring. Hmmmmm. What's so old fashioned here? I drank the sodas. It was a nice refreshing taste that reminded me of a weak, watery root beer. I was also surprised that it had very little carbonation. Is this the way birch beer is supposed to taste? I'm somewhat disappointed. I doubt if I'll buy any more of this brand, but I may well try some other brand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\\nSummarize:  Somewhat Disappointing.\",\n",

       " 'Summarize Task\\nReview: Orange bitters are an essential ingredient in the Sazerac cocktail -- \"Official Cocktail of the City of New Orleans\" -- which carries a history as complex as does the Crescent City.<br /><br />The most famous orange bitters were compounded by Antoine Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Peychaud, a Haitian apothecary who moved to New Orleans in the early 1800s.  He dispensed a proprietary mix of aromatic bitters from an old family recipe to relieve the ails of his clients, and became famous for a toddy he made for his friends:  French brandy, bitters, a splash of water and a bit of sugar.<br /><br />The drink was soon served in bars throughout the city.  Sewell Taylor, proprietor of one such \"coffeehouse,\" began importing and serving Sazerac-du-Forge et fils brandy, leading to the renaming of the \"Sazerac Coffee House\" with its 12 bartenders mixing \"Sazeracs\" for their patrons.<br /><br />Around 1870, the primary ingredient of the Sazerac was changed from cognac to rye whiskey due to popular American tastes and the difficulty of obtaining cognac.  Somewhere along the line a dash of absinthe was added to coat the glass, later changed to \"Herbsaint\" -- et voil&agrave;! -- the modern Sazerac cocktail.<br /><br />Orange bitters may also be used in other drinks where bitters are called for, as a matter of taste.  I took a liking to an alternative Sazerac recipe including both Angostura bitters and orange bitters.  Because I could not be assured that Peychaud\\'s bitters would be sufficiently \\'orange\\' or just a close cousin to Angostura, I tried Regan\\'s Orange Bitters.  They are distinctive and offer another flavor to the alcoholic spice cabinet, but I cannot say whether they are better than Peychaud\\'s -- the original New Orleans concoction.<br /><br />Unless you are really a cocktail purist and have access to an extensively stocked bar, keeping all the \"authentic\" Sazerac ingredients -- Rye, Herbsaint, and one or two varieties of bitters -- is probably unreasonable.  And when making exotic cocktails, of course we must value Reason above all else.\\nSummarize:  WHO REALLY NEEDS IT?',\n",

       " 'Summarize Task\\nReview: As a buyer of this prior, I am somewhat surprised to see this once 1 POUND had been reduced to just 12 ounces the last time I bought. Now? Just 11 ounces? Aside from the shrinking amount of coffee for the price (leaves a bad taste in my mouth!), how about the coffee? Well, I really have a liking for anything vanilla from juicing, to smoothies and coffee too. When drip brewed, I find this coffee a bit too full flavored (slightly bitter to me) and add a bit of creamer to soften it a bit. I am not a huge coffee drinker since a recent heart attack and had to go to decaf so this new batch is for my wife. She doesn\\'t care at ALL for this brand however unless she pours in about 3-4 ounces of dairy creamer (coffee-mate French Vanilla from Nestle) so the price is just crazy for me when I see how she \"modifies it\"! But this is from a guy who just drinks a cup of instant Folgers decaf every morning these days (sad I know).<br /><br />  So I have to defer to the connoisseurs on snob appeal and such. To me, it has always just been a nice cup of coffee before I was no longer able to drink with any caffeine. This brand was just one in a bunch of experiments I treated myself too after retirement before the heart attack. To ME, it is just an \"average\" coffee with an above average price. To be fair, remember I am not a big coffee person so this is perspective from an old guy who just was a casual drinker of coffee, not a fanatic. I just don\\'t see the value given both my wife and myself added so much coffee creamer to get the desired taste of Vanilla? I still rate this 3 stars (average) since I may just not be the type of coffee drinker to \"appreciate\" something I just don\\'t get. For what it\\'s worth, I also prefer grilled hamburgers over grilled steak.

This tea is truly top quality and tastes perfect the way it is. I consider this Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea an essential tea to have for anyone who drinks and serves tea to guests.

I thought it was maybe just a bad batch but over time it has proven to be either a new formulation or maybe just a less fatty part of the tuna being used.  It is also clear that Natural Value is fraudulently claiming  AAFCO compliance in their formulation.  Under pressure from  misguided pet owners and Internet cranks this manufacturer removed menadione from their fish based formulations. AFFCO requires the use of vitamin K3 (menadione) in any cat food product containing greater than 25% fish on a dry matter basis, and for good reason. I have labels from previous and new cans and the new ones clearly do not list the required vitamin K supplementation.  So, Natural Value is either lying about the actual ingredients or about the AAFCO label statement.  In either case, I can't trust this company anymore.  I used to buy their cat food by the case at Whole Foods.  If your cat happens to like this product, I think it would be OK only as a treat (since it does have a great basic ingredients list), definitely not as a regular entire meal. Even if this were a trustworthy product, it is probably best to limit exposure for cats to apex predators (that accumulate toxins) like tuna anyway.\\nSummarize:  My cat hates it now.\",\n",

       " \"Summarize Task\\nReview: I wish I could send this back, but I take the blame and call it a life lesson...try a smaller amount first! Seems so obvious now.  If i were reading this, I'd think I was dumb too, who orders 2.5lbs of a product (normally used in small quantities) without tasting it first? I know, I know.  I'm an idiot.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I know this is raw, and I'm not calling the Sunfood folks liars, I'm sure it is, and I've bought and liked a number of their other branded products (from their website), but: this has a very bitter taste to it that sort of leaves the overall impression of burntness/ashiness as the flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty intensely cacao-y, but it's also flat and harsh at the same time.<br /><br />And no, I'm not confusing raw cacao powder with cocoa or sweetened cacao or any other thing.  I've tried 5 other brands of raw cacao powder and liked them all, to varying degrees (8-10 on a love scale).  We were going through about 8-12oz a week in our green smoothies so I thought I'd go with this to try and save some money, and since I'd liked every other brand we'd tried, I didn't think anything of buying a huge quantity of a brand I hadn't tried. Now I know better!! I'd put this closer to a 3-4 on a scale of 1-10.  It's OK to use in very small quantities to impart a vaguely chocolatey flavor (like a teaspoon in pancake batter), but other than that, the bitter ashiness really rears its head.<br /><br />I'm so irritated with myself for buying this without trying it, that at this point we're basically just not having smoothies (and my morning banana-cacao smoothie was something to look forward to!)<br /><br />My guess is that in a month or so, we'll finally admit to ourselves that we threw money away, suck it up and just chuck it all.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the Sunfood brand raw cacao powder is fattier and (therefore) more caloric than other brands.  I don't know if that has something to do with the flavor profile (doubtful though because raw cacao butter, which is the extracted fat, is neither bitter nor ashy).<br /><br />SO disappointed.\\nSummarize:  Disappointing\",\n",

       " \"Summarize Task\\nReview: I'm a granola eater, big time. Bars, trail mix, thins, cookies, whatever, put granola in it, I'll eat it. I'd never had the opportunity to try the KIND brand, so I was glad to give this stuff a try. Right out of the package, I liked the cinnamon-sugar aroma and flavor, and I found the granola itself to be crunchy and tasty, without being overly sweet, cloying, or cereal-like. With the various seeds and quinoa mixed in, this was more like trail mix or cereal than clusters, but I didn't especially have a problem with it. I've heard flax seeds are healthy for you and I'd never had them before. For the most part, I'm okay with them, but some of the seeds don't break apart easily once they are in your mouth, and I had more than a few husks and hulls get stuck between my teeth and gums. Personally, I wasn't too happy about that, but other than that, taste was decent, texture was good, (this does make a nice texture enhancer in yogurt), and it appears to be higher protein and lower calorie than your average granola. So, this KIND snack is nothing outstanding and nothing terribly bad, earning a middle-of-the-road rating as an average-but-not-special product.\\nSummarize:  KIND of okay, actually\",\n",

       " 'Summarize Task\\nReview: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain\\'s Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn\\'t stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold</a>. It\\'s a very nice coffee, though don\\'t expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won\\'t go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.\\nSummarize:  Unremarkable',\n",

Nicknamed \"Thumper\" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper\\'s adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper\\'s life. \"If you can\\'t say something nice, don\\'t say nothing at all!\" formed the basis of what is now known as \"The Thumperian Principle\" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper\\'s career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, \"Suck My Carrot\", \"Young Bunny Coed Love\", and finally, \"The Bunny Hole\".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the \"Shake A Leg Foundation\" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.\\nSummarize:  Thumper Rabbit RIP',\n",

More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken.

The first flavor that hits you is salt, followed by a slightly sour taste akin to condensed milk, finished off by an overwhelming sweetness.  Not once did I enjoy the creamy mouthfeel or the complex flavor I associate with a good caramel.<br /><br />For the price they charge, I expect delicate, balanced flavors with proper texture.

Whereas NOW Foods (at this time, they are being sold for $27 for 3 packs, $9 per pack) is only 12 ounces for $9. I've tried both, and in terms of freshness, they are roughly the same, but NOW Foods walnuts are noticeably a bit larger. But when it comes down to it, it's really about the amount you're consuming -the weight, and not size. And you can get way more for less if you go with TJ's. Unless, you're using these walnuts for some kind of fancy display or something on a cake, or for guests. But, I've never seen anyone make a cake with whole walnuts smothered all over it or use a walnut as a centerpiece.<br /><br />BUT, if you plan on buying the NOW Foods Organic line of walnuts, which run for about $10-$11 per pack on Amazon, they are more worth the cost since they are noticeably fresher and overall richer in taste compared to this bulk package of regular walnuts. I've never found a rancid nut in NOW Food's organic walnuts.

Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a \"premium\" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.

I have also heard that the combination of a Moon-Pie and RC was big in the 1950\\'s but sounds like too much suga for me. Either way the 1950\\'s was their heyday and they spent tons on advertising especially with celebrity sponsors like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.<br /><br />Packaging: It is sold in plastic, glass and cans and like many sodas the glass bottle tastes better but good luck finding it. SMOOTHNESS: It is more smooth than Coca-Cola, but more uppity than Pepsi. CARBONATION: RC has average carbonation, the big two colas are a bit more fizzy. SWEETNESS: It is a little lighter in sweetness than the 2 big colas. COLA Flavor: You can taste the cola pretty well.<br /><br />In 1954, it was the first brand to be sold in an all aluminum can, the first to offer a low calorie diet cola, and a caffeine free soda.
